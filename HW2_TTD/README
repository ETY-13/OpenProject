This is the readme for CS372 HW2. The purpose of the assignment is to spend at least 45 minutes 
doing TTD practice on our own. I decided to do my TDD on the fizzBuzz problem as described by 
Michael Whelan is his blog: https://www.michael-whelan.net/code-katas-for-practicing-tdd/. 

More description on the fizzBuzz problem can be found at Michael Whelan's GitHub page:
https://github.com/mwhelan/Katas/tree/master/Katas.FizzBuzz


I divided my test into 4 sections.
Section 1:    
          Test if the generator returns the right vector with the 
          correct items.

Section 2:
      Test whether all number divisible by 3 is changed into buzz.

Section 3:
      Test whether all number divisible by 5 is changed into fizz.

Section 4:
      Test, whether all number divisible by 3 is buzz and all number divisible by 5 
      is fizz, and all number divisble by both is fizzBuzz. 

My code only tests whether the vector has the right items and it does not
print out the item as shown by Michael Whelan.
