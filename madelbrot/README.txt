Blake Caldwell and Theng Yang CS 301 Project

For our project, Blake and I worked on producing a full Mandelbrot image with C++ and compare the performance to Cuda. Our C++ and Cuda codes are in the project_c.tar and project_cuda.tar files. Both the C++ and Cuda codes are also on NetRun and are meant to be run within NetRun because some of the libraries, such as "osl/gpu_vec.h" and "lib/inc.h", that we use are those included in NetRun by Professor Lawlor. Both codes are similar and produce the same Mandelbrot image. The only difference is that in C++, we use a function to compute the Mandelbrot, and in Cuda, we use the GPU. This, of course, results in a significant performance difference. 

We wanted to do something more than just producing two images and compare the performance speed, so we decided to make a Javascript version of our Mandelbrot and do more with it, including getting the Julia sets within the Mandelbrot. Our Javascript code is in sketch.js, and we use home.html to display the script. We use the p5js library to draw and display our Mandelbrot and Julia set. More information on p5js can be found at https://p5js.org. The main computational code is the same as our C++ code with small changes and varies function calls to set variables and pixels and update the display.
